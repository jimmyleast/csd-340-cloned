## Course Description

This course examines the fundamentals specific to web development. Topics will include web standards, accessibility/usability, and the markup languages, which serve as the foundation for web development: Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML5), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Extensible Markup Language (XML). 
Students work with these languages at a basic level, learning the essential structures, coding conventions, and best practices associated with the effective use of HTML5 and CSS in modern web-development environments.

Prerequisite: None
